In this project I:

* Initially encountered difficulty understanding what to do or how to progress,
so I went back and re-studied material until I felt comfortable with all of the
concepts.
* Took my time to develop a proper algorithm, which enabled me to think through steps until I had logically created an order or steps to follow, and in order to break this project into more manageable sized pieces to tackle.
* Learned about the concept of starting with a working console version of the project, so that I could be sure that the logic of the project was solid before concerning myself with the visual rendering of the project.
* Practiced creating forms and using input data in real time
* Practiced using factory functions
* Practiced utilizing the module pattern and IIFEs
* Practiced seperating the concerns of the project into different modules, and calling upon needed functions from another module
* Practiced reviewing my code for DRY and other coding principles (to the best of my ability and that I am aware of at this point)
